You should put the variable definitions and sets above the recipes in the Makefile.

You do not need the console recipe in your Makefile, just change the kernel.o target to ${O_FILES} and it will work.

You have the // Futer code will go here comment but then you did not put the future code there, you put it at the bottom, which defeats the point of the header guard.

You also have a big long #define that repeats the MY_OS_INCLUDE_CONSOLE_H.

Why is there VIDEO_MEMORY and VGA_BUFFER? Just use the VGA_BUFFER.

You do not reset the style byte in your clear_terminal. You also hard coded the dimension (i*2) instead of using the consts.

You do not reset the terminal_position to 0 at the end of clear_terminal and thus subsequent prints after a clear will appear in seemingly random places.

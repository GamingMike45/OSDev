Watch the 2/14 supplementary lecture and read the OSEnvironmentInstall.docx instructions. Get your development environment up and running.

 

Please follow the instructions carefully and let me know if you have any difficulty.

 

1) Enter your virtual machine.

 

2) Open a command line and create a folder to work in. I call mine myos so I do - mkdir myos

 

3) You will need to download the test OS files. Run the command

wget elvis.rowan.edu/~mckeep82/os/myos.zip

unzip myos.zip

This should generate the source code files for the test os.

 

4) To generate an os binary, run the command make clean followed by the command make

 

5) This should launch a qemu window with your kernel up and running.

 

6) Next, we want to try to clear the screen. Generate a function called "clear_terminal()" inside your kernel.c file and call it inside your main function. To do this you will need a function header before the main declaration. To clear a screen you must write a null character to every visual byte and a 0x07 to every style byte. You can do this with a single for loop as discussed in class.

 

7) Adjust your main so that you call clear_terminal() first and then your Hello World code. That should print Hello World to an empty screen.

 

8) As discussed in class you want to make sure you load the proper number of sectors. Check the num_sectors variable in boot.asm and make sure it matches the size of your kernel. If not, adjust accordingly using the equation - Ceiling ((size of os.bin - 512) / 512)

 

9) NOTE - It is OK if the cursor is not in the correct position. That is handled by a separate piece of hardware that we will discuss in Chapter 5.

 

10) Once your output looks correct, zip up the contents of your folder using 

zip -r myos.zip .

In your myos folder. Send me the myos.zip file as your submission.
